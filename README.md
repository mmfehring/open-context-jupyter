# ANTH 641 Week 6_2

Differently than early in-class activities, there is no specific markdown file providing instructions on your Week 6_2 exercise. Make sure to fork this repo and set up your own mybinder.org environment to run the Jupyter notebooks - copy the binder link and replace the one below. When you launch your binder open the notebook called __ANTH 641_Week 6-Exercise-2__. You'll complete the exercise right in that notebook and download it with the name YOURNAME_Week-6_Exercise-2 and put it into your forked repo. The notebook was adapted from the original Open Context notebook by Eric Kansa.

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks Relating to Open Context (https://opencontext.org) and some other APIs, including Chronicling America and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. These notebooks will help people get started using Open Context in "open science" and reproducible research workfolows. Please feel free to fork and adapt this repo for your own needs. Open Context notebooks originally by Eric Kansa, updated by Shawn Graham. It seems a bit eclectic, but the patterns should help you also adapt for other APIs you might encounter.
